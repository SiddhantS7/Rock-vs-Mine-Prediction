Rock or Mine Prediction with Logistic Regression in Python
This repository contains Python code for building a Logistic Regression model to predict whether an object is Rock or Mine based on SONAR data.

Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the application of Logistic Regression for binary classification. We will:
1.Load the SONAR dataset containing features extracted from sonar signals.
2.Preprocess the data by handling missing values and scaling features.
3.Split the data into training and testing sets.
4.Build a Logistic Regression model and train it on the training data.
5.Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
6.Predict whether new data points are likely Rock or Mine.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
1.numpy
2.pandas
3.sklearn.model_selection
4.sklearn.linear_model
